character entities are not required to have a trailing semicolon:
`&copy` is perfectly okay for `©`.

npm install character-entities-legacy
```

## Usage

```js
var characterEntitiesLegacy = require('character-entities-legacy')

console.log(characterEntitiesLegacy.copy) // => '©'
console.log(characterEntitiesLegacy.frac34) // => '¾'
console.log(characterEntitiesLegacy.sup1) // => '¹'
```

## API
