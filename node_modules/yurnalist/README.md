# Yurnalist

An elegant console reporter, borrowed from [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

## Introduction

Pretty console output makes developers happy and Yarn is doing a nice job. Yurnalist takes the internal console reporter code from Yarn and makes it available for use in other Node.js applications.

The current version is based on code from Yarn v1.13.0.

Yurnalist can be used to report many different things besides simple messages.

### Features

* log, info, warn, succes, error & command messages
* progress bars
* activity spinners
* process steps
* object inspection
* lists
* emojis
* trees
* tables
* user question
* user select
* program header & footer

## Install

```sh
yarn add yurnalist
```

Or if your prefer NPM

```sh
npm install yurnalist
```

## How to use

Here is an example showing a combination of different reporter API functions.

```javascript
import report from 'yurnalist'

/* A function to fake some async task */
function waitNumberOfSecs(secs) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, secs * 1000));
}

async function fetchSomething() {
  report.info('Please wait while I fetch something for you.');
  report.warn('It might take a little while though.');

  const spinner = report.activity();
  spinner.tick('I am on it!');

  try {
    await waitNumberOfSecs(1);
    spinner.tick('Still busy...');
    await waitNumberOfSecs(1);
    spinner.tick('Almost there...');
    await waitNumberOfSecs(1);
    report.success('Done!');
  } catch (err) {
    report.error(err);
  }

  spinner.end();
}

fetchSomething();

```

## Requirements

Node >= 4

## Examples

Examples showing different API functions are found in [/examples](/examples). You can run them directly with node >= 7.6 (because of async/await syntax). For older versions you could use the `--harmony` flag, or otherwise Babel.

To run the activity example:

```sh
node examples/activity.js
```

## Configuration

A normal import gives you a reporter instance configured with defaults for easy use. If you want something else you can call `createReporter(options)` to give you an instance with different options.

### Options

These are the options of the reporter as defined by Flow:

```javascript
type ReporterOptions = {
  verbose?: boolean,
  stdout?: Stdout,
  stderr?: Stdout,
  stdin?: Stdin,
  emoji?: boolean,
  noProgress?: boolean,
  silent?: boolean,
  nonInteractive?: boolean,
  peekMemoryCounter?: boolean
};
```

The defaults used are:

```javascript
const defaults = {
  verbose: false,
  stdout: process.stdout,
  stderr: process.stderr,
  stdin: process.stdin,
  emoji: true,
  noProgress: false,
  silent: false,
  nonInteractive: false,
  peekMemoryCounter: false
}
```

The peekMemoryCounter is disabled by default. If you enable it, you'll have to call `reporter.close()` to stop its running timer. Otherwise your program will not exit. The memory counter can be used to display in the footer data.

## API

The API still needs some documentation, but most methods are straightforward. In the meantime you can also look at the [examples](./examples) and possibly even the [tests](./__tests__).

The following functions are available:

* table
* step
* inspect
* list
* header
* footer
* log
* success
* error
* info
* command
* warn
* question
* tree
* activitySet
* activity
* select
* progress
* close
* createReporter

## Language

Yarn uses a language file for certain messages. For example if you try to skip a required question, or when you pick an invalid item from a select. This language file is not yet exposed in the Yurnalist API. The only supported language is English, as it is in Yarn at the moment.

I plan to make this configurable so that you can define your own messages in your own language .

## Emojis

You can use Emojis in your output. Yurnalist should disable them if they are not allowed in the application environment.

## Credits

Of course ❤️ and credits to all the contributers of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). The ease with which I was able to extract this module from their codebase is proving some awesome engineering skills.
