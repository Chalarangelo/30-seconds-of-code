# jpeg-js

A pure javascript JPEG encoder and decoder for node.js

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/eugeneware/jpeg-js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/eugeneware/jpeg-js)

## Installation

This module is installed via npm:

``` bash
$ npm install jpeg-js
```

## Example Usage

### Decoding JPEGs

Will decode a buffer or typed array into a `Buffer`;

``` js
var jpeg = require('jpeg-js');
var jpegData = fs.readFileSync('grumpycat.jpg');
var rawImageData = jpeg.decode(jpegData);
console.log(rawImageData);
/*
{ width: 320,
  height: 180,
  data: <Buffer 5b 40 29 ff 59 3e 29 ff 54 3c 26 ff 55 3a 27 ff 5a 3e 2f ff 5c 3c 31 ff 58 35 2d ff 5b 36 2f ff 55 35 32 ff 5a 3a 37 ff 54 36 32 ff 4b 32 2c ff 4b 36 ... > }
*/
```

To decode directly into a `Uint8Array`, pass `true` as the second argument to
`decode`:

``` js
var jpeg = require('jpeg-js');
var jpegData = fs.readFileSync('grumpycat.jpg');
var rawImageData = jpeg.decode(jpegData, true); // return as Uint8Array
console.log(rawImageData);
/*
{ width: 320,
  height: 180,
  data: { '0': 91, '1': 64, ... } } // typed array
*/
```

### Encoding JPEGs

``` js
var jpeg = require('jpeg-js');
var width = 320, height = 180;
var frameData = new Buffer(width * height * 4);
var i = 0;
while (i < frameData.length) {
  frameData[i++] = 0xFF; // red
  frameData[i++] = 0x00; // green
  frameData[i++] = 0x00; // blue
  frameData[i++] = 0xFF; // alpha - ignored in JPEGs
}
var rawImageData = {
  data: frameData,
  width: width,
  height: height
};
var jpegImageData = jpeg.encode(rawImageData, 50);
console.log(jpegImageData);
/*
{ width: 320,
  height: 180,
  data: <Buffer 5b 40 29 ff 59 3e 29 ff 54 3c 26 ff 55 3a 27 ff 5a 3e 2f ff 5c 3c 31 ff 58 35 2d ff 5b 36 2f ff 55 35 32 ff 5a 3a 37 ff 54 36 32 ff 4b 32 2c ff 4b 36 ... > }
*/
```

### Decoding

This library builds on the work of two other JPEG javascript libraries,
namely [jpgjs](https://github.com/notmasteryet/jpgjs) for the decoding
which is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License below:

### Encoding

The encoding is based off a port of the JPEG encoder in [as3corelib](https://code.google.com/p/as3corelib/source/browse/trunk/src/com/adobe/images/JPGEncoder.as).

The port to Javascript was done by by Andreas Ritter, www.bytestrom.eu, 11/2009.
