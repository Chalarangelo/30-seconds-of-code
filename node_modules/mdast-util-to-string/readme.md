[**mdast**][mdast] utility to get the plain text content of a node.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install mdast-util-to-string
```

## Usage

```js
var unified = require('unified')
var parse = require('remark-parse')
var toString = require('mdast-util-to-string')

var tree = unified()
  .use(parse)
  .parse('Some _emphasis_, **importance**, and `code`.')

console.log(toString(tree)) // => 'Some emphasis, importance, and code.'
```

## API

### `toString(node)`

Get the text content of a [node][].

The algorithm checks `value` of `node`, then `alt`, and finally `title`.
If no value is found, the algorithm checks the children of `node` and joins them
(without spaces or newlines).

> This is not a markdown to plain-text library.
> Use [`strip-markdown`][strip-markdown] for that.
