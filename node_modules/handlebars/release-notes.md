# Release Notes

## Development

[Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.1.2...master)

## v4.1.2 - April 13th, 2019
Chore/Test:
- [#1515](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/pull/1515) - Port over linting and test for typings ([@zimmi88](https://api.github.com/users/zimmi88))
- chore: add missing typescript dependency, add package-lock.json - 594f1e3
- test: remove safari from saucelabs - 871accc

Bugfixes: 
- fix: prevent RCE through the "lookup"-helper - cd38583

Compatibility notes:

Access to the constructor of a class thought `{{lookup obj "constructor" }}` is now prohibited. This closes 
a leak that only half closed in versions 4.0.13 and 4.1.0, but it is a slight incompatibility.

This kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described
in #1495. We will **not** increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented, 
and because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version
and the issue may not be resolved on many systems). 

[Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.1.1...v4.1.2)

## v4.1.1 - March 16th, 2019
Bugfixes:
- fix: add "runtime.d.ts" to allow "require('handlebars/runtime')" in TypeScript - 5cedd62

Refactorings:
- replace "async" with "neo-async" - 048f2ce
- use "substring"-function instead of "substr" - 445ae12

Compatibility notes:
- This is a bugfix release. There are no breaking change and no new features.


[Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.1.0...v4.1.1)

## v4.1.0 - February 7th, 2019
New Features

- import TypeScript typings - 27ac1ee

Security fixes:

- disallow access to the constructor in templates to prevent RCE - 42841c4, #1495

Housekeeping

- chore: fix components/handlebars package.json and auto-update on release - bacd473
- chore: Use node 10 to build handlebars - 78dd89c
- chore/doc: Add more release docs - 6b87c21

Compatibility notes:

Access to class constructors (i.e. `({}).constructor`) is now prohibited to prevent
Remote Code Execution. This means that following construct will no work anymore:

```
class SomeClass {
}

SomeClass.staticProperty = 'static'

var template = Handlebars.compile('{{constructor.staticProperty}}');
document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = template(new SomeClass());
// expected: 'static', but now this is empty.
```

This kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described in #1495. We will **not** increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented, and because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version and the issue may not be resolved on many systems).

- Fix location information for programs - [93faffa](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/commit/93faffa)

Compatibility notes:
- Depthed paths are now conditionally pushed on to the stack. If the helper uses the same context, then a new stack is not created. This leads to behavior that better matches expectations for helpers like `if` that do not seem to alter the context. Any instances of `../` in templates will need to be checked for the correct behavior under 4.0.0. In general templates will either reduce the number of `../` instances or leave them as is. See [#1028](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1028).
- The `=` character is now HTML escaped. This closes a potential exploit case when using unquoted attributes, i.e. `<div foo={{bar}}>`. In general it's recommended that attributes always be quoted when their values are generated from a mustache to avoid any potential exploit surfaces.
- AST constructors have been dropped in favor of plain old javascript objects
- The runtime version has been increased. Precompiled templates will need to use runtime of at least 4.0.0.

- Expose escapeExpression on the root object - 980c38c
- Remove nested function eval in blockHelperMissing - 6f22ec1
- Fix compiler program de-duping - 9e3f824

Compatibility notes:

- Runtime compatibility breaks in both directions. Ensure that both compiler and client are upgraded to 2.0.0-beta.1 or higher at the same time.
  - `programWithDepth` has been removed an instead an array of context values is passed to fields needing depth lookups.
- `false` values are now printed to output rather than silently dropped
- Lines containing only block statements and whitespace are now removed. This matches the Mustache spec but may cause issues with code that expects whitespace to exist but would not otherwise.
- Partials that are standalone will now indent their rendered content
- `AST.ProgramNode`'s signature has changed. 
- Numerious methods/features removed from psuedo-API classes
  - `JavaScriptCompiler.register`

- Temporarily kill the AWS publish CI step - 8347ee2

Compatibility notes:
- A JSON polyfill is required to run the compiler under IE8 and below. It's recommended that the precompiler be used in lieu of running the compiler on these legacy environments.

- [#704](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/pull/704) - JavaScript Compiler Cleanup ([@blakeembrey](https://github.com/blakeembrey))

Compatibility notes:
- `helperMissing` helper no longer has the indexed name argument. Helper name is now available via `options.name`.

- `JavaScriptCompiler.compilerInfo` now returns generic objects rather than javascript source.
- AST changes
  - INTEGER -> NUMBER
  - Additional PartialNode hash parameter
  - New RawBlockNode type
- Data frames now have a `_parent` field. This is internal but is enumerable for performance/compatibility reasons.

- [#587](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/587) - Partial inside partial breaks?


Compatibility notes:
- The project now includes separate artifacts for AMD, CommonJS, and global objects. 
  - AMD: Users may load the bundled `handlebars.amd.js` or `handlebars.runtime.amd.js` files or load individual modules directly. AMD users should also note that the handlebars object is exposed via the `default` field on the imported object. This [gist](https://gist.github.com/wycats/7417be0dc361a69d5916) provides some discussion of possible compatibility shims.
  - CommonJS/Node: Node loading occurs as normal via `require`
  - Globals: The `handlebars.js` and `handlebars.runtime.js` files should behave in the same manner as the v1.0.12 / 1.0.0 release.
- Build artifacts have been removed from the repository. [npm][npm], [components/handlebars.js][components], [cdnjs][cdnjs], or the [builds page][builds-page] should now be used as the source of built artifacts. 
- Context-stored helpers are now always passed the `options` hash. Previously no-argument helpers did not have this argument.


[Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v1.0.12...v1.1.0)

## v1.0.12 / 1.0.0 - May 31 2013

- [#515](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/515) - Add node require extensions support ([@jjclark1982](https://github.com/jjclark1982))
- [#517](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/517) - Fix amd precompiler output with directories ([@blessenm](https://github.com/blessenm))
- [#433](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/433) - Add support for unicode ids
- [#469](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/469) - Add support for `?` in ids
- [#534](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/534) - Protect from object prototype modifications
- [#519](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/519) - Fix partials with . name ([@jamesgorrie](https://github.com/jamesgorrie))
- [#519](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/519) - Allow ID or strings in partial names
- [#437](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/437) - Require matching brace counts in escaped expressions
- Merge passed partials and helpers with global namespace values
- Add support for complex ids in @data references
- Docs updates

Compatibility notes:
- The parser is now stricter on `{{{`, requiring that the end token be `}}}`. Templates that do not
  follow this convention should add the additional brace value.
- Code that relies on global the namespace being muted when custom helpers or partials are passed will need to explicitly pass an `undefined` value for any helpers that should not be available.
- The compiler version has changed. Precompiled templates with 1.0.12 or higher must use the 1.0.0 or higher runtime.

## Prior Versions

When upgrading from the Handlebars 0.9 series, be aware that the
signature for passing custom helpers or partials to templates has
changed.

```js
template(context, helpers, partials, [data])
```

Use:

```js
template(context, {helpers: helpers, partials: partials, data: data})
```
