# 5.0.0-rc.1

To ease adoption of the v5.0 release, we have relaxed the node version
check performed by npm at installation time to allow for node 4, which
remains officially unsupported, but likely to continue working for the
time being.

# 5.0.0-rc.0

This release has **BREAKING CHANGES** that were required to fix regressions
in 4.0.0 and to make the Combinator Node API consistent for all combinator
types. Please read carefully.

## Summary of Changes

* The way a descendent combinator that isn't a single space character (E.g. `.a  .b`) is stored in the AST has changed.
* Named Combinators (E.g. `.a /for/ .b`) are now properly parsed as a combinator.
* It is now possible to look up a node based on the source location of a character in that node and to query nodes if they contain some character.
* Several bug fixes that caused the parser to hang and run out of memory when a `/` was encountered have been fixed.
* The minimum supported version of Node is now `v6.0.0`.

### Changes to the Descendent Combinator

In prior releases, the value of a descendant combinator with multiple spaces included all the spaces.

* `.a   .b`: Extra spaces are now stored as space before.
  - Old & Busted:
    - `combinator.value === "   "`
  - New hotness:
    - `combinator.value === " " && combinator.spaces.before === "  "`
* `.a   /*comment*/.b`: A comment at the end of the combinator causes extra space to become after space.
  - Old & Busted:
    - `combinator.value === "   "`
    - `combinator.raws.value === "   /*comment/"`
  - New hotness:
    - `combinator.value === " "`
    - `combinator.spaces.after === "  "`
    - `combinator.raws.spaces.after === "  /*comment*/"`
* `.a<newline>.b`: whitespace that doesn't start or end with a single space character is stored as a raw value.
  - Old & Busted:
    - `combinator.value === "\n"`
    - `combinator.raws.value === undefined`
  - New hotness:
    - `combinator.value === " "`
    - `combinator.raws.value === "\n"`

### Support for "Named Combinators"

Although, nonstandard and unlikely to ever become a standard, combinators like `/deep/` and `/for/` are now properly supported.

Because they've been taken off the standardization track, there is no spec-official name for combinators of the form `/<ident>/`. However, I talked to [Tab Atkins](https://twitter.com/tabatkins) and we agreed to call them "named combinators" so now they are called that.

Before this release such named combinators were parsed without intention and generated three nodes of type `"tag"` where the first and last nodes had a value of `"/"`.

* `.a /for/ .b` is parsed as a combinator.
  - Old & Busted:
    - `root.nodes[0].nodes[1].type === "tag"`
    - `root.nodes[0].nodes[1].value === "/"`
  - New hotness:
    - `root.nodes[0].nodes[1].type === "combinator"`
    - `root.nodes[0].nodes[1].value === "/for/"`
* `.a /F\6fR/ .b` escapes are handled and uppercase is normalized.
  - Old & Busted:
    - `root.nodes[0].nodes[2].type === "tag"`
    - `root.nodes[0].nodes[2].value === "F\\6fR"`
  - New hotness:
    - `root.nodes[0].nodes[1].type === "combinator"`
    - `root.nodes[0].nodes[1].value === "/for/"`
    - `root.nodes[0].nodes[1].raws.value === "/F\\6fR/"`

### Source position checks and lookups

A new API was added to look up a node based on the source location.

```js
const selectorParser = require("postcss-selector-parser");
// You can find the most specific node for any given character
let combinator = selectorParser.astSync(".a > .b").atPosition(1,4);
combinator.toString() === " > ";
// You can check if a node includes a specific character
// Whitespace surrounding the node that is owned by that node
// is included in the check.
[2,3,4,5,6].map(column => combinator.isAtPosition(1, column));
// => [false, true, true, true, false]
```

# 4.0.0

This release has **BREAKING CHANGES** that were required to fix bugs regarding values with escape sequences. Please read carefully.

* **Identifiers with escapes** - CSS escape sequences are now hidden from the public API by default.
  The normal value of a node like a class name or ID, or an aspect of a node such as attribute
  selector's value, is unescaped. Escapes representing Non-ascii characters are unescaped into
  unicode characters. For example: `bu\tton, .\31 00, #i\2764\FE0Fu, [attr="value is \"quoted\""]`
  will parse respectively to the values `button`, `100`, `i❤️u`, `value is "quoted"`.
  The original escape sequences for these values can be found in the corresponding property name
  in `node.raws`. Where possible, deprecation warnings were added, but the nature
  of escape handling makes it impossible to detect what is escaped or not. Our expectation is
  that most users are neither expecting nor handling escape sequences in their use of this library,
  and so for them, this is a bug fix. Users who are taking care to handle escapes correctly can
  now update their code to remove the escape handling and let us do it for them.

* **Mutating values with escapes** - When you make an update to a node property that has escape handling
  The value is assumed to be unescaped, and any special characters are escaped automatically and
  the corresponding `raws` value is immediately updated. This can result in changes to the original
  escape format. Where the exact value of the escape sequence is important there are methods that
  allow both values to be set in conjunction. There are a number of new convenience methods for
  manipulating values that involve escapes, especially for attributes values where the quote mark
  is involved. See https://github.com/postcss/postcss-selector-parser/pull/133 for an extensive
  write-up on these changes.


**Upgrade/API Example**

In `3.x` there was no unescape handling and internal consistency of several properties was the caller's job to maintain. It was very easy for the developer
to create a CSS file that did not parse correctly when some types of values
were in use.

```js
const selectorParser = require("postcss-selector-parser");
let attr = selectorParser.attribute({attribute: "id", operator: "=", value: "a-value"});
attr.value; // => "a-value"
attr.toString(); // => [id=a-value]
// Add quotes to an attribute's value.
// All these values have to be set by the caller to be consistent:
// no internal consistency is maintained.
attr.raws.unquoted = attr.value
attr.value = "'" + attr.value + "'";
attr.value; // => "'a-value'"
attr.quoted = true;
attr.toString();  // => "[id='a-value']"
```

In `4.0` there is a convenient API for setting and mutating values
that may need escaping. Especially for attributes.

```js
const selectorParser = require("postcss-selector-parser");

// The constructor requires you specify the exact escape sequence
let className = selectorParser.className({value: "illegal class name", raws: {value: "illegal\\ class\\ name"}});
className.toString(); // => '.illegal\\ class\\ name'

// So it's better to set the value as a property
className = selectorParser.className();
// Most properties that deal with identifiers work like this
className.value = "escape for me";
className.value; // => 'escape for me'
className.toString(); // => '.escape\\ for\\ me'

// emoji and all non-ascii are escaped to ensure it works in every css file.
className.value = "😱🦄😍";
className.value; // => '😱🦄😍'
className.toString(); // => '.\\1F631\\1F984\\1F60D'

// you can control the escape sequence if you want, or do bad bad things
className.setPropertyAndEscape('value', 'xxxx', 'yyyy');
className.value; // => "xxxx"
className.toString(); // => ".yyyy"

// Pass a value directly through to the css output without escaping it. 
className.setPropertyWithoutEscape('value', '$REPLACE_ME$');
className.value; // => "$REPLACE_ME$"
className.toString(); // => ".$REPLACE_ME$"

// The biggest changes are to the Attribute class
// passing quoteMark explicitly is required to avoid a deprecation warning.
let attr = selectorParser.attribute({attribute: "id", operator: "=", value: "a-value", quoteMark: null});
attr.toString(); // => "[id=a-value]"
// Get the value with quotes on it and any necessary escapes.
// This is the same as reading attr.value in 3.x.
attr.getQuotedValue(); // => "a-value";
attr.quoteMark; // => null

// Add quotes to an attribute's value.
attr.quoteMark = "'"; // This is all that's required.
attr.toString(); // => "[id='a-value']"
attr.quoted; // => true
// The value is still the same, only the quotes have changed.
attr.value; // => a-value
attr.getQuotedValue(); // => "'a-value'";

// deprecated assignment, no warning because there's no escapes
attr.value = "new-value";
// no quote mark is needed so it is removed
attr.getQuotedValue(); // => "new-value";

// deprecated assignment, 
attr.value = "\"a 'single quoted' value\"";
// > (node:27859) DeprecationWarning: Assigning an attribute a value containing characters that might need to be escaped is deprecated. Call attribute.setValue() instead.
attr.getQuotedValue(); // => '"a \'single quoted\' value"';
// quote mark inferred from first and last characters.
attr.quoteMark; // => '"'

// setValue takes options to make manipulating the value simple.
attr.setValue('foo', {smart: true});
// foo doesn't require any escapes or quotes.
attr.toString(); // => '[id=foo]'
attr.quoteMark; // => null 

// An explicit quote mark can be specified
attr.setValue('foo', {quoteMark: '"'});
attr.toString(); // => '[id="foo"]'

// preserves quote mark by default
attr.setValue('bar');
attr.toString(); // => '[id="bar"]'
attr.quoteMark = null;
attr.toString(); // => '[id=bar]'

// with no arguments, it preserves quote mark even when it's not a great idea
attr.setValue('a value \n that should be quoted');
attr.toString(); // => '[id=a\\ value\\ \\A\\ that\\ should\\ be\\ quoted]'

// smart preservation with a specified default
attr.setValue('a value \n that should be quoted', {smart: true, preferCurrentQuoteMark: true, quoteMark: "'"});
// => "[id='a value \\A  that should be quoted']"
attr.quoteMark = '"';
// => '[id="a value \\A  that should be quoted"]'

// this keeps double quotes because it wants to quote the value and the existing value has double quotes.
attr.setValue('this should be quoted', {smart: true, preferCurrentQuoteMark: true, quoteMark: "'"});
// => '[id="this should be quoted"]'

// picks single quotes because the value has double quotes
attr.setValue('a "double quoted" value', {smart: true, preferCurrentQuoteMark: true, quoteMark: "'"});
// => "[id='a "double quoted" value']"

// setPropertyAndEscape lets you do anything you want. Even things that are a bad idea and illegal.
attr.setPropertyAndEscape('value', 'xxxx', 'the password is 42');
attr.value; // => "xxxx"
attr.toString(); // => "[id=the password is 42]"

// Pass a value directly through to the css output without escaping it. 
attr.setPropertyWithoutEscape('value', '$REPLACEMENT$');
attr.value; // => "$REPLACEMENT$"
attr.toString(); // => "[id=$REPLACEMENT$]"
```

# 3.1.2

* Fix: Removed dot-prop dependency since it's no longer written in es5.

# 3.1.1

* Fix: typescript definitions weren't in the published package.

# 3.1.0

* Fixed numerous bugs in attribute nodes relating to the handling of comments
  and whitespace. There's significant changes to `attrNode.spaces` and `attrNode.raws` since the `3.0.0` release.
* Added `Attribute#offsetOf(part)` to get the offset location of
  attribute parts like `"operator"` and `"value"`. This is most
  often added to `Attribute#sourceIndex` for error reporting.

# 3.0.0

## Breaking changes

* Some tweaks to the tokenizer/attribute selector parsing mean that whitespace
  locations might be slightly different to the 2.x code.
* Better attribute selector parsing with more validation; postcss-selector-parser
  no longer uses regular expressions to parse attribute selectors.
* Added an async API (thanks to @jacobp100); the default `process` API is now
  async, and the sync API is now accessed through `processSync` instead.
* `process()` and `processSync()` now return a string instead of the Processor
  instance.
* Tweaks handling of Less interpolation (thanks to @jwilsson).
* Removes support for Node 0.12.

## Other changes

* `ast()` and `astSync()` methods have been added to the `Processor`. These
  return the `Root` node of the selectors after processing them.
* `transform()` and `transformSync()` methods have been added to the
  `Processor`. These return the value returned by the processor callback
  after processing the selectors.
* Set the parent when inserting a node (thanks to @chriseppstein).
* Correctly adjust indices when using insertBefore/insertAfter (thanks to @tivac).
* Fixes handling of namespaces with qualified tag selectors.
* `process`, `ast` and `transform` (and their sync variants) now accept a
  `postcss` rule node. When provided, better errors are generated and selector
  processing is automatically set back to the rule selector (unless the `updateSelector` option is set to `false`.)
* Now more memory efficient when tokenizing selectors.

### Upgrade hints

The pattern of:

`rule.selector = processor.process(rule.selector).result.toString();`

is now:

`processor.processSync(rule)`

# 2.2.3

* Resolves an issue where the parser would not reduce multiple spaces between an
  ampersand and another simple selector in lossy mode (thanks to @adam-26).

# 2.2.2

* No longer hangs on an unescaped semicolon; instead the parser will throw
  an exception for these cases.

# 2.2.1

* Allows a consumer to specify whitespace tokens when creating a new Node
  (thanks to @Semigradsky).

# 2.2.0

* Added a new option to normalize whitespace when parsing the selector string
  (thanks to @adam-26).

# 2.1.1

* Better unquoted value handling within attribute selectors
  (thanks to @evilebottnawi).

# 2.1.0

* Added: Use string constants for all node types & expose them on the main
  parser instance (thanks to @Aweary).

# 2.0.0

This release contains the following breaking changes:

* Renamed all `eachInside` iterators to `walk`. For example, `eachTag` is now
  `walkTags`, and `eachInside` is now `walk`.
* Renamed `Node#removeSelf()` to `Node#remove()`.
* Renamed `Container#remove()` to `Container#removeChild()`.
* Renamed `Node#raw` to `Node#raws` (thanks to @davidtheclark).

* Fixes misinterpretation of Sass interpolation (e.g. `#{foo}`) as an
  id selector (thanks to @davidtheclark).

and;

* Fixes parsing of attribute selectors with equals signs in them
  (e.g. `[data-attr="foo=bar"]`) (thanks to @montmanu).
* Adds `quoted` and `raw.unquoted` properties to attribute nodes
  (thanks to @davidtheclark).

# 1.3.3

* Fixes an infinite loop on `)` and `]` tokens when they had no opening pairs.
  Now postcss-selector-parser will throw when it encounters these lone tokens.

# 1.3.2

* Now uses plain integers rather than `str.charCodeAt(0)` for compiled builds.

# 1.3.1

* Update flatten to v1.x (thanks to @shinnn).

# 1.3.0

* Adds a new node type, `String`, to fix a crash on selectors such as
  `foo:bar("test")`.

# 1.2.1

* Fixes a crash when the parser encountered a trailing combinator.

# 1.2.0

* A more descriptive error is thrown when the parser expects to find a
  pseudo-class/pseudo-element (thanks to @ashelley).
* Adds support for line/column locations for selector nodes, as well as a
  `Node#sourceIndex` method (thanks to @davidtheclark).

# 1.1.4

* Fixes a crash when a selector started with a `>` combinator. The module will
  now no longer throw if a selector has a leading/trailing combinator node.

# 1.1.3

* Fixes a crash on `@` tokens.

# 1.1.2

* Fixes an infinite loop caused by using parentheses in a non-pseudo element
  context.

# 1.1.1

* Fixes a crash when a backslash ended a selector string.

# 1.1.0

* Adds support for replacing multiple nodes at once with `replaceWith`
  (thanks to @jonathantneal).
* Parser no longer throws on sequential IDs and trailing commas, to support
  parsing of selector hacks.

# 1.0.1

* Fixes using `insertAfter` and `insertBefore` during iteration.

# 1.0.0

* Adds `clone` and `replaceWith` methods to nodes.
* Adds `insertBefore` and `insertAfter` to containers.
* Stabilises API.

# 0.0.5

* Fixes crash on extra whitespace inside a pseudo selector's parentheses.
* Adds sort function to the container class.
* Enables the parser to pass its input through without transforming.
* Iteration-safe `each` and `eachInside`.

# 0.0.4

* Tidy up redundant duplication.
* Fixes a bug where the parser would loop infinitely on universal selectors
  inside pseudo selectors.
* Adds `length` getter and `eachInside`, `map`, `reduce` to the container class.
* When a selector has been removed from the tree, the root node will no longer
  cast it to a string.
* Adds node type iterators to the container class (e.g. `eachComment`).
* Adds filter function to the container class.
* Adds split function to the container class.
* Create new node types by doing `parser.id(opts)` etc.

* Adds `first` and `last` getters to the container class.
* Adds `every` and `some` iterators to the container class.
* Add `empty` alias for `removeAll`.
* Combinators are now types of node.
* Fixes the at method so that it is not an alias for `index`.
* Tidy up creation of new nodes in the parser.
