This script is intended for use as a GYP_GENERATOR. It takes as input (by way of
the generator flag config_path) the path of a json file that dictates the files
and targets to search for. The following keys are supported:
files: list of paths (relative) of the files to search for.
test_targets: unqualified target names to search for. Any target in this list
that depends upon a file in |files| is output regardless of the type of target
or chain of dependencies.
additional_compile_targets: Unqualified targets to search for in addition to
test_targets. Targets in the combined list that depend upon a file in |files|
are not necessarily output. For example, if the target is of type none then the
target is not output (but one of the descendants of the target will be).

The following is output:
error: only supplied if there is an error.
compile_targets: minimal set of targets that directly or indirectly (for
  targets of type none) depend on the files in |files| and is one of the
  supplied targets or a target that one of the supplied targets depends on.
  The expectation is this set of targets is passed into a build step. This list
  always contains the output of test_targets as well.
test_targets: set of targets from the supplied |test_targets| that either
  directly or indirectly depend upon a file in |files|. This list if useful
  if additional processing needs to be done for certain targets after the
  build, such as running tests.
status: outputs one of three values: none of the supplied files were found,
  one of the include files changed so that it should be assumed everything
  changed (in this case test_targets and compile_targets are not output) or at
  least one file was found.
invalid_targets: list of supplied targets that were not found.

Example:
Consider a graph like the following:
  A     D
 / \
B   C
A depends upon both B and C, A is of type none and B and C are executables.
D is an executable, has no dependencies and nothing depends on it.
If |additional_compile_targets| = ["A"], |test_targets| = ["B", "C"] and
files = ["b.cc", "d.cc"] (B depends upon b.cc and D depends upon d.cc), then
the following is output:
|compile_targets| = ["B"] B must built as it depends upon the changed file b.cc
and the supplied target A depends upon it. A is not output as a build_target
as it is of type none with no rules and actions.
|test_targets| = ["B"] B directly depends upon the change file b.cc.

Even though the file d.cc, which D depends upon, has changed D is not output
as it was not supplied by way of |additional_compile_targets| or |test_targets|.

If the generator flag analyzer_output_path is specified, output is written
there. Otherwise output is written to stdout.

In Gyp the "all" target is shorthand for the root targets in the files passed
to gyp. For example, if file "a.gyp" contains targets "a1" and
"a2", and file "b.gyp" contains targets "b1" and "b2" and "a2" has a dependency
on "b2" and gyp is supplied "a.gyp" then "all" consists of "a1" and "a2".
Notice that "b1" and "b2" are not in the "all" target as "b.gyp" was not
directly supplied to gyp. OTOH if both "a.gyp" and "b.gyp" are supplied to gyp
then the "all" target includes "b1" and "b2".
