/**
 * Add custom field resolvers to the GraphQL schema.
 *
 * Allows adding new fields to types by providing field configs, or adding resolver
 * functions to existing fields.
 *
 * Things to note:
 * * Overriding field types is disallowed, instead use the `createTypes`
 *   action. In case of types added from third-party schemas, where this is not
 *   possible, overriding field types is allowed.
 * * New fields will not be available on `filter` and `sort` input types. Extend
 *   types defined with `createTypes` if you need this.
 * * In field configs, types can be referenced as strings.
 * * When extending a field with an existing field resolver, the original
 *   resolver function is available from `info.originalResolver`.
 * * The `createResolvers` API is called as the last step in schema generation.
 *   Thus, an intermediate schema is made available on the `intermediateSchema` property.
 *   In resolver functions themselves, it is recommended to access the final
 *   built schema from `info.schema`.
 * * Gatsby's data layer, including all internal query capabilities, is
 *   exposed on [`context.nodeModel`](/docs/node-model/). The node store can be
 *   queried directly with `getAllNodes`, `getNodeById` and `getNodesByIds`,
 *   while more advanced queries can be composed with `runQuery`. Note that
 *   `runQuery` will call field resolvers before querying, so e.g. foreign-key
 *   fields will be expanded to full nodes. The other methods on `nodeModel`
 *   don't do this.
 * * It is possible to add fields to the root `Query` type.
 * * When using the first resolver argument (`source` in the example below,
 *   often also called `parent` or `root`), take care of the fact that field
 *   resolvers can be called more than once in a query, e.g. when the field is
 *   present both in the input filter and in the selection set. This means that
 *   foreign-key fields on `source` can be either resolved or not-resolved.
