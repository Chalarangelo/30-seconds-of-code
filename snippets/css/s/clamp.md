Responsive typography has been in fashion for a while now, but some developers find it hard to implement. This is usually due to confusing algebraic formulas or complex hacks. Luckily, CSS has introduced the `clamp()` function, which makes it easy to create responsive typography with a single line of code. All you need to do is set the minimum, maximum, and preferred value and the browser will do the rest.

```css
h2 {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 5vw, 3rem);
}
```

For a more complex example, take a look at the [Fluid typography snippet](/css/s/fluid-typography).
