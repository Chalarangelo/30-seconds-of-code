### Sleep

Delay executing part of an `async` function, by putting it to sleep, returning a `Promise`.

```js
const sleep = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
/*
async function sleepyWork() {
  console.log('I\'m going to sleep for 1 second.');
  await sleep(1000);
  console.log('I woke up after 1 second.');
}
*/
```
