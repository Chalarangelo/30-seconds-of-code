Changes the URL of the remote repository.

- Use `git remote set-url origin <url>` to change the URL of the remote repository to `<url>`.

```shell
git remote set-url origin <url>
```

```shell
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code
# The remote URL is now "https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code"
```
