# Contribution Guidelines

**30 seconds of code** is supported by the community, so feel free to contribute in any way you can to help!

## How you can help

- Participate in community Discussions.
- Submit Issues or Pull Requests related to bugs, improvements, typos etc.

## Ground rules

Breaking any of these rules will result in your pull request being closed. Please follow these guidelines above all else:

- **Always be polite and respectful to others** and try to follow the advice of the maintainer.
- **Only modify files under the `content/snippets` or `content/collections` directories**, when making changes to the website content (i.e. bug fixes or improvements).
- **Use discussions for q&a, ideas, suggestions, etc.**, and issues for bugs, improvements, feature requests, etc. If you're unsure, use discussions.

## Writing guidelines

All content on the website should follow the guidelines below. These guidelines are not exhaustive, but they should be followed as closely as possible.

### Language

- Use words and language that our audience understands.
- Use American spelling for all content.
- Write short sentences (ideally 20 words or less).
- Make sure each sentence has a single focus.
- Edit unnecessary or repeated words.
- Avoid idioms and phrases with indirect or ironic meanings.
- Avoid jargon and overly technical terms.
- Aim for a Grade 10 reading level or below.
- Use contractions to create a natural voice, but don’t overdo it with contractions that are hard to pronounce or aren’t used often.
- Conversely, not using a contraction can be used to add emphasis.
- Directional language (e.g. “above”, “below”) may only be used as part of a piece of content to indicate a relevant section of the content (e.g. “the above code example”).
- Prefer non-directional language if possible. Replace “above” and “below” for section indication with “previous” and “following”.

### Voice

- Prefer writing in an active voice wherever possible.
- Avoid writing in a passive voice.
- Prefer a passive voice if you want to emphasize the action instead of the subject, clarify that an action wasn’t taken by a certain person or to avoid referring to the subject (i.e. the 30 seconds of code team or yourself).
- Use imperative voice when documenting code snippets (e.g. “use this method”).
- Don’t use permissive language (e.g. “you can use this method”).

### Capitalization

- Capitalize the first letter of a sentence, lowercase the rest.
- Keep the original capitalization of terminology (e.g. "JavaScript"), acronyms (e.g. "CRUD"), products (e.g. "GitHub Actions") or trademarks (e.g. "Netlify") anywhere they’re used on the website.

### Punctuation

- Avoid ampersands (&), as they focus attention in the wrong part of the sentence. Spell out the word “and” instead.
- Use apostrophes to represent omitted numbers or letters, contractions or to form possessives.
- Use quotation marks to define words or quoted text.
- Avoid using periods in the middle of sentences, unless it’s inside an inline code block or part of a term (e.g. "Node.js").
- Use colons in the middle of sentences sparingly.
- Use a colon to preface a list.
- Use periods only to finish full sentences.
- Use question marks sparingly. Try rewording to an affirmative if possible.
- Do not use the oxford comma (also known as the serial comma) in sentences.
- Don’t use commas to separate bulleted or numbered list items.
- The ellipses (...) can be used in place of a missing piece of text. Avoid using ellipses in regular text, use them only in headings.
- Avoid exclamation marks as much as possible. If you really have to use one, limit them to one per page.
- Avoid semicolons if possible. Try replacing them with a comma, the word “and” or splitting the sentence in two separate sentences.
- Use hyphens without spaces for ranges.
- Use hyphens in place of regular dashes inside a sentence with a space on either side.
- Use hyphens to form compound modifiers.

### Terminology

- Use terminology sparingly and only when necessary.
- Only use industry-standard or well-established terminology.
- Explain terms if you’re not sure the reader understands them.
- Link to any relevant content on the website, if possible.

### Emphasis

- Use bold sparingly to highlight important information on the page.
- Don’t use bold to create a heading.
- Use italics to quote text, usually in the form of short verbatim phrases.
- Use quotation blocks for longer sentences when you want to draw particular attention to them. Limit yourself to one quotation block per page.

### Dates

- Use the American English format for dates ({month} {date}, {year}).
- Use the 3-letter abbreviation for months, followed by a period.
- Do not add nominal suffixes to date numbers.
- Don’t write dates numerically.

### Code

- Wrap inline code blocks in the appropriate visual element.
- Wrap important values to the code such as numerals, strings or boolean values in the appropriate visual element.
- Use multiline code blocks wherever the code spans more than one line.
- Provide appropriate language context and highlighting to multiline code blocks.
- Use the full name or the name that’s closest to the official documentation when describing native code (e.g. "Function.prototype.apply()").
- Do not use code blocks in headings.

### Personal pronouns

- Use “I” or “my” for personal opinions, experiences or when you want to express your personal voice.
- Use “we” or “our” when referring to the 30 seconds of code team.
- Use “we” or “our” when the audience is supposed to be following along and you want to sound reassuring.
- Use “you” or “your” when explaining something to the audience and you want to sound authoritative.

### Headings

- Capitalize the first word of a heading, lowercase the rest if the heading is formatted as a sentence.
- You may capitalize the first letter of each word if the heading is not formatted as a sentence.
- Avoid using punctuation such as periods, commas, colons or semicolons.
- Headings may use a question mark if the content is a question-type article.
- Keep headings short. Avoid headings that are longer than one line.
- Limit headings to a single sentence. The only exception to this is headings that span multiple short questions.
- Headings need to be informative and descriptive.
- Avoid clickbait-type headings.
- Use headings that help the user understand what they’ll find in the related content.
- Use headings to make content easier to scan.
- Use a hyphen surrounded by a single space on either side for articles that are part of a series.
- For tip-type articles, start the heading with the word “Tip” followed by a colon and a space.
- Omit articles such as “the”, “a” and “an” in regular headings if possible.
- Omit articles such as “the”, “a” and “an” in microcopy.
- You can use ampersands (&) in microcopy headings to make the heading shorter.

### Lists

- Use bulleted (unordered) lists wherever possible.
- Use numbered (ordered) lists for listicles or sequences of steps.
- Prefer bulleted lists over numbered lists for documenting code snippets.
- List items should start with a capital letter in all cases.
- Don’t use commas or semicolons at the end of list items.
- If any list item contains two or more sentences, punctuate all list items.
- If all list items are one sentence or fragments, don’t punctuate.
- Use bulleted lists to make content easier to scan.

### Actions

- Actions should lead with a strong verb when possible (e.g. “Search”, “View all”).
- Capitalize the first word of an action, lowercase the rest.
- Label links in a predictable way.
- If a link leads to a page with its own heading (e.g. Snippet, Article or Collection), prefer using the original heading of the content.
- Links in full sentences should be applied only to the relevant text, not the entire sentence.
- Links in full sentences must be descriptive, either on their own or based on their surrounding context.

### Alternative text

- Provide alternative text for visual content whenever possible.
- Use empty alternative text for decorative visual content.
- Alternative text should help users navigate the site and provide an accessible experience.
- Use plain language and avoid unnecessary words.
