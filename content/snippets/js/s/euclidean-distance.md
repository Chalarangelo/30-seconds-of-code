Calculates the distance between two points in any number of dimensions.

- Use `Object.keys()` and `Array.prototype.map()` to map each coordinate to its difference between the two points.
- Use `Math.hypot()` to calculate the Euclidean distance between the two points.

```js
const euclideanDistance = (a, b) =>
  Math.hypot(...Object.keys(a).map(k => b[k] - a[k]));
```

```js
euclideanDistance([1, 1], [2, 3]); // ~2.2361
euclideanDistance([1, 1, 1], [2, 3, 2]); // ~2.4495
```
