Most of us are familiar with jquery and probably quite a few of us are familiar with the Chrome console's `$` and `$$` shorthands for query selectors. I recently figured out a way to replicate these shorthands in my code, using `Document.querySelector()`, `Document.querySelectorAll()` and `Function.prototype.bind()`. Here's how to do it, just make sure you don't mix them up with jquery if you are still using it:

```js
const $ = document.querySelector.bind(document);
const $$ = document.querySelectorAll.bind(document);

const mainContent = $('.main-content');
const externalLinks = $$('a[target="_blank"]');
```
