Hey there! <span class="wave">üëã</span>

It's been a little while since the last update, so I thought I'd drop by with a quick status update. I've been quietly working on some new pieces and reading up on the latest trends in web development and design.

After a very relaxing summer, I realized I need more of that in my life. So, I've decided to take a **short break from content creation and development** for the time being. There's no specific plan or timeline for this break, and I'll most likely write sporadically whenever I have something worth sharing.

What this means for the website is that **you can expect content to be a bit more sparse over the next few months**. **GitHub issues and pull requests will be closed for the foreseeable future**, as I won't be active enough to take care of any requests coming in.

I hope to recharge and refocus a little bit during this time off. I'll also try to reorganize my idea backlog, so that, when I finally return, I can work on new ideas that truly excite me.

See you in a little while! üçª
