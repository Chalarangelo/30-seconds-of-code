This is a **test** snippet. It is intended to provide a centralized place to _test_ all sorts of `markdown` content that one could produce in a post.

## This is a level 2 heading with `some code`

Links come in all shapes and sizes. They are often in the form of an automatically generated reference, such as `Array.from()`.

And some other times, you might get a mixed content link, such as a link for the [modulo operator(`%`)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Remainder), which needs to be carefully styled to make sure it looks good.

```js [aFunction.js]
// First we need to make sure lines that are 80 characters long fit snugly here.
const aFunction = (a, b = 2) => {
  if (a === b) return b;
  const c = a * b;
  const d = a > b ? `${a} is larger` : `${a} is smaller`;
  const e = 'something';
  return [e, { c, d }];
};
```

There's a few more elements and some cases we should cover just to be safe.

Tables are quite special and they may be used in a few places. Let's make sure they look great.

1. This is a list item
2. Part of an ordered list
3. That has a few items
   1. Sometimes we have sub-items
