          30 seconds of code is an accessible high-quality knowledge base for
          developers of all skill levels, established in 2017. Since then,
          hundreds of short code snippets and programming articles have been
          created with the help of a large community of contributors. The goal
          is to make software development more accessible and help the open
          source community thrive by helping people learn to code.

          seconds of code is a side project I work on in my free time. My love
          for development and learning is what sparkled this idea and I've put a
          lot of effort into making it the best resource I've never had when I
          started out as a developer.
