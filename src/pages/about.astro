      <h2>Project</h2>
      <p>
        30 seconds of code is an accessible high-quality knowledge base for
        developers of all skill levels, established in 2017. Since then,
        hundreds of short code snippets and programming articles have been
        created with the help of a large community of contributors. The goal
        is to make software development more accessible and help the open
        source community thrive by helping people learn to code.

      <h2>Maintainers</h2>
      <p>
        30 seconds of code is developed, maintained and curated by <a
            href={settings.ownerUrl}
            target='_blank'
            rel='noopener noreferrer'>{settings.ownerName}</a
          >. I'm a professional software engineer, based in Greece, and 30
          seconds of code is a side project I work on in my free time. My love
          for development and learning is what sparkled this idea and I've put a
          lot of effort into making it the best resource I've never had when I
          started out as a developer.
