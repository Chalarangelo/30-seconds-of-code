## Placement guide

![placement-guide](/logo-resources/placement-guide.png)

The free space around our logo is calculated using the top inner circle of the letter "3" in the logo. The minimum free space around the logo is a full circle on either side on the horizontal axis and half a circle on either side on the vertical axis. 

## Small use guidance

The 30 seconds of code logo should have a minimum width of 30px in digital applications and approximately 1cm in print.

## Logo misuse

- Never crop, rotate, invert, or distort the logo.
- Never add an outline, shadow, or glow to the logo.
- Never use any other color for the logo, except for the ones provided in this guide.
- Avoid using the logo in busy backgrounds or against backgrounds where itâ€™s hard to distinguish.
