  JavaScript generator functions introduce a way to define an iterative
  algorithm by writing a function with non-continuous execution. This
  practically means they allow you to create a new generator every time you call
  a generator function, which can then be iterated over just like any other
  iterable.

  JavaScript generator functions are an advanced yet very powerful ES6 feature,
  which you can start using in your code right now.
