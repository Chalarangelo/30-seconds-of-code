An IP address is a number assigned to a device connected to a network that uses the Internet protocol.
Two IP versions are currently in use - IPv4, the older version of the communication protocol (e.g. 192.168.1.100) and IPv6, the newest version of the communication protocol which allows for many different IP addresses (e.g. 0:0:0:0:ffff:c0a8:164).
