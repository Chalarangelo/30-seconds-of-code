### Event-driven-programming

Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events (e.g. user actions, thread messages, sensor outputs).
In event-driven applications, there is usually a main loop that listens for events and trigger callback functions accordingly when one of these events is detected.
