Google Chrome's developer tools are nothing short of amazing, but there are a few missing tools that can increase your productivity even further. Here are my personal favorite extensions that I use everyday:

### CSS Peeper

### React Developer Tools
[React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) is the de facto extension when working with React, providing all the necessary inspection tools for your React applications.

### LastPass

### JSON Viewer
