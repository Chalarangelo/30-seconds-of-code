Google Chrome's developer tools are nothing short of amazing, but there are a few missing tools that can increase your productivity even further. Here are my personal favorite extensions that I use everyday:

1. CSS Peeper
[CSS Peeper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/css-peeper/mbnbehikldjhnfehhnaidhjhoofhpehk?hl=en) is an all-in-one tool for CSS inspection that allows you to quickly peek at the styles, fonts, color palettes and assets of any website you want.

2. React Developer Tools
[React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) is the de facto extension when working with React, providing all the necessary inspection tools for your React applications.

3. LastPass
[LastPass](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass-free-password-ma/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd?hl=en) keeps your accounts and API keys secure, by providing a free password manager complete with password generation and password-protected notes.

4. uBlock Origin
[uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) is a simple yet effective ad blocker extension that you can just install and forget about, as it keeps your browsing experience ad-free.

5. VisBug

6. JSON Viewer
[JSON Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh?hl=en) provides some much needed syntax highlighting and style customization to JSON responses, which are nowadays very commonplace in most web APIs.

7. EditThisCookie
